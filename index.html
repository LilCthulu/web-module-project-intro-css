    <p class = 'sub-box'>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the power of glaciers, the
      persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.</p>

    <p class = 'sub-box'>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200
      square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much
      more.</p>
